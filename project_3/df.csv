AMA I'm Nicole Perlroth, the New York Times's cybersecurity reporter who [broke the news](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-burisma-ukraine.html) that Burisma — the Ukrainian gas company at the heart of President Trump's impeachment inquiry — was recently hacked by the same Russian hackers who broke into the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta's email inbox back in 2016.

 New details emerged on Tuesday of [Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/us/politics/trump-impeachment-articles.html), intensifying demands on Senate Republicans to include witness testimony and additional documents in the impeachment trial.

 Kremlin-directed hackers infiltrated Democratic email servers to interfere with the 2016 American election. Emboldened by their past success, new evidence indicates that they are trying again — The Russian plan for hacking the 2020 election is well underway.

9276,"دلایل اهمال کاری چه چیزهایی هستند؟ بررسی ۵ عامل مهم 
دلایل اهمال کاری ، ۵ عامل مهم
=============================

برای همه ما پیش آمده که در موقعیت‌های خاصی دچار اهمال کاری یا به تعویق انداختن کارهایمان شده باشیم. اهمال کاری به معنای این است که به دلایل گوناگون، کاری که باید در زمان مناسب خودش انجام شود عقب بیاندازیم. این موضوع خیلی وقت‌ها می‌تواند برای ما دردسر های زیادی به وجود آورد.
   
 برای همین هم بهتر است که ابتدا دلایل اهمال کاری خود را بررسی کرده و پیدا کنیم.
   
 سپس به دنبال راه حل های کاربردی برای [غلبه بر تنبلی](https://soheilamani.com/how-to-overcome-laziness/) و اهمال کاری باشیم. 
   
اما شما چطور، چرا ما اغلب اوقات اهمال کاری می‌کنیم و کارهایمان را به تعویق می‌اندازیم؟
   
چه راهکارهایی برای برطرف کردنش می‌شناسید و چگونه باید با این مشکل مقابله کنید؟

۱- برنامه ریزی غلط یکی از دلایل اهمال کاری است
----------------------------------------------

در بسیاری از موارد علت اصلی اهمال کاری و به تعویق انداختن کارها، برنامه ریزی غلط ماست.
   
 به این صورت که شما انجام کارهای حیاتی و مهم خود را به بعد از کارهای غیر ضروری تر موکول کنید.
   
 در این حالت شما انرژی و انگیزه کافی برای انجام آن کار در زمان مناسب خودش را ندارید.
   
 یکی دیگر از مصادیق برنامه ریزی غلط، برنامه ای است که واقع گرایانه نباشد و شما از پس آن بر نیایید.
   
 در این حالت هم نخواهید توانست به خوبی از برنامه پیروی کنید و ناچار به اهمال کاری روی می‌آورید.
   

برای مقابله با مشکل برنامه‌ریزی که یکی از دلایل اهمال کاری به حساب می‌آید، بهتر است که آنرا خود را طوری تنظیم کنیم که بخش‌های مختلف آن به‌راحتی قابل اجرا باشند. زمان زیادی را صرف طراحی برنامه خود کنید.
   
 شاید فکر کنید که این کار وقت زما را هدر خواهد داد، اما مطمئن باشید شکست خوردن شما در اجرای برنامه‌تان که در نهات به اهمال کاری ختم می‌شود، زمان بیشتری از شما می‌گیرد.

اگر برنامه ریزی بلد نیستی و میخوای اون رو بطور کامل یاد بگیری
   
 همین حالا مقاله [برای درس خواندن چگونه برنامه ریزی کنیم](https://soheilamani.com/how-to-plan-for-study/) رو مطالعه کن

 

۲- مدیریت نادرست زمان
---------------------

مدیریت زمان مهمترین بخش زندگی هر آدم موفقی است که می‌شناسید.
   
 ما انسان ها در طول روز زمان محدودی را در اختیار داریم که باید به بهترین شکل آن را مدیریت کنیم.
   
 اینگونه قادر خواهیم بود که همه کارهایمان را سر وقت و به خوبی انجام دهیم.
   
 اما ناتوانی در مدیریت زمان یکی از بزرگترین دلایل اهمال کاری به حساب می‌آید.
   
 این اتفاق معمولا زمانی می‌افتد که فرد با خود می‌گوید “حالا فعلا وقت دارم، بعدا انجامش می‌دم.
   
 کمبود زمان باعث اختلال و بی نظمی درونی و در نهایت به تعویق انداختن کارها و اهمال کاری می‌شود.

برای اینکه این مشکل را هم برطرف کنید بهتر است که سعی کنید لیستی از تمامی کارهایی که قرار است در طول روز انجام دهید را تهیه کرده و بر طبق آن پیش بروید. حتی می‌توانید از اپلیکیشن‌ها هم بهره ببرید.
   
اپلیکیشن هایی مثل [Todoist](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist&amp;hl=en) یک انتخاب خوب برای برنامه ریزی کردن کارهای روزانه به شمار می‌روند.

 

۳- ضعف در تصمیم گیری از دیگر دلایل اهمال کاری است
-------------------------------------------------

تصمیمات اشتباه ما همیشه عواقب خاص خودشان را خواهند داشت.
   
 انتخاب اینکه کدام کار را قبل‌از دیگری انجام دهیم در بسیاری موارد موجب بروز مشکلاتی برای ما خواهد شد.
   
 به همین دلیل هم بهتر است قبل از تصمیم‌گیری در مورد انجام کارها، اول آن ها را به ترتیب اولویت‌بندی کنیم.
   
 سعی کنید ابتدا کارهایی را انجام دهید که به اصطلاح واجب‌تراند. سپس به موارد کوچکتر و کم اهمیت تر بروید. مثلا یک [روش درس خواندن برای امتحان](https://soheilamani.com/how-to-study-for-exams/) این است که شما اول به سراغ بخش هایی بروید که بلد نیستید. اینگونه انرژی بیشتری برای یادگیری مطالب مربوط به این بخش ها خواهید داشت. 

 

   
“هر انسانی میتواند در هر زمانی هر حجمی از کار را به خوبی انجام دهد،
   
البته به شرط اینکه قرار باشد در آن زمان، کار دیگری را انجام دهد!”

روبرت بنچلی (کمدین امریکایی)

۴- کارهای دقیقه نودی
--------------------

یکی از بدترین عادات ما ایرانی ها، به تعویق انداختن کارها به آخرین لحظات یا همان دقیقه نود است.
   
 برای مثال معمولا همیشه درس خواندمان را به روزهای آخر منتهی به امتحان موکول می‌کنیم و هیچگاه در طول ترم درس نمی‌خوانیم. وقتی کاری به صورت لحظه آخری یا دقیقه نودی انجام شود، ضریب خطا کردن و ناقص انجام دادن آن به شدت بالا می‌رود.

دقیقه نودی بودن که یکی از **دلایل اهمال کاری** به شمار‌ می‌رود با تقسیم بندی کارها قابل درمان است.
   
 برای این کار سعی کنید کارهای سخت و دشوار مثل درس خواندن را به بخش های کوچکتر تقسیم بندی کنید و آنها را در طول زمانی که در اختیار داریم انجام دهیم.

 

۵- کمال گرایی، آخرین مورد از دلایل اهمال کاری
---------------------------------------------

گاهی اوقات کمال گرایی باعث می‌شود که ما برخی از کارهایمان را عقب بیندازیم.
   
 با این توجیه که در زمان مناسب‌تری آن‌ها را با کیفیت بهتر انجام خواهیم داد.
   
 یا حتی با وجودی‌ که کاری را  تقریبا به پایان رسانده‌ایم، آنرا به طور کامل تکمیل نمی‌کنیم تا در فرصت بیشتر، نواقص و ضعف‌های احتمالی آن را بهبود ببخشیم.

این موضوع هم یکی دیگر از دلایل اهمال کاری به شمار می‌رود. به یاد دارم دوستی داشتم که دقیقا چنین شرایطی داشت و هر وقت شانس به او رو می‌کرد به این بهانه که هنوز برای انجام آن کار آماده نیست و نیاز به یادگیری چیزهای بیشتری دارد، آن را از دست می‌داد.

160,"Coronavirus Megathread A novel coronavirus, likely transmitted from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan, China, has now infected more than 6,000 people. There have been 130+ confirmed deaths attributed to the virus and it's now in 18 countries.

Since the outbreak, there have been a lot of sensational headlines and up-to-the-minute reporting about the dire futures we may all face. If you are seeking accurate information, without the wild speculation, please refer to the following sources:

[The CDC's Dedicated Coronavirus Resource,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html)

[The WHO's Dedicated Coronavirus Resource,](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus)

And the [University of Chicago School of Medicine's handy FAQ style resource.](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/prevention-and-screening-articles/wuhan-coronavirus)

&amp;nbsp;

The WHO even made a short video to answer some of the common questions they're getting. [Check it out here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=OZcRD9fV7jo&amp;feature=emb_title)

&amp;nbsp;

And for those too lazy to click on the University of Chicago Med [resource](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/prevention-and-screening-articles/wuhan-coronavirus), here are some of the answers to commonly asked questions:

&amp;nbsp;

**What is a coronavirus? What is a novel coronavirus?**

A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it’s a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular virus from Wuhan is being called the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV.

&amp;nbsp;

**How does the Wuhan coronavirus spread?**

So far, there’s limited information about the Wuhan novel coronavirus, including how easy it is to spread and how dangerous it is. But we know the virus can be transmitted from person to person and it is passed by coughing and other close contact.

Close contact is a vague term that means a lot of things to different people. But in this case, it specifically means being within about six feet of someone for a prolonged period of time without wearing recommended personal protective equipment such as a disposable face mask. It could also be having direct contact with infectious secretions of someone who has a case of the virus (for example: being coughed on) while not wearing personal protective equipment.

That can sound scary, but it’s important to know that influenza is also transmitted the same way.

&amp;nbsp;

**Is this coronavirus deadly?**

The numbers of how many people have been diagnosed or how many have died are changing rapidly. Without accurate numerators and denominators, the jury’s still out. That said, we do know that more than 100 people in China have died from this virus. Based on the information I’m seeing, it looks very similar to SARS in a number of ways — except for the fact that it’s likely less deadly, but more transmittable.

&amp;nbsp;

**What are the symptoms of the virus?**

We’re still learning more about Wuhan novel coronavirus, but we know it typically causes flu-like symptoms including a fever, cough and congestion. Some patients — particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions — develop a severe form of pneumonia.

&amp;nbsp;

**How do you treat patients with this virus? Can you vaccinate against it?**

Things like antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria, not a virus. So typically doctors can treat the symptoms, but not the virus itself. There’s no vaccine yet.
